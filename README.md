# Lars-GPSDO-V4.2
This is a significant improvement to the first version that can be found in a different repository.
There is also a companion board that interfaces to the outside world with insulated signals. This is a separate project called GPSDO V4 Interface.

The BOM's are of limited value because I do not specify the actual mfg partnumbers that can be ordered. I merely specify the value and the footprint.

The Arduino Nano sketch has a number of improvements, most notably the support for obtaining the Qerr value from the NEO, the automatic TC functionality, support for a room temperature sensor and a real 16-bit DAC.

A lot of detail can be found on my Blog here: https://www.paulvdiyblogs.net/2023/06/gpsdo-version-4.html
Be sure to visit that regularly to see if there are any updates.

The boards can be ordered through PCBWay, or the Gerbers can be downloaded there. I have created a Shared Project. Search for DIY GPSDO. 
PCBway had some questions about the parts they used for a customer that wanted a full assembly. I added comments to a document that they used to ask for my input.
The Q&A documents is called "QA for BOM 10MHz GPSDO V4.2.pdf"
I also included the Centroid files for both sides, they have the .pos suffix

It seems that JLCPCB is not happy with the standard Gerber information, so I produced a special ZIP file that was produced with their "production" plug-in for KiCad. It should have all the information in it they want. The JLCPCB Zip file contains the Gerber Zip file you need to upload and that has the extra files in it so you can upload everything in one go.

Many of the parts I used are not critical. If you find that one item is no longer in stock or available, you can look for a replacement that is about the same as what I used. Just use common sense.
